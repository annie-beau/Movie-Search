# Movie-Search

Users can search for a movie and click to see more information about the movie.

## Features
- Searches dynamically as the user types
- Loads next page of results at the end of scrolling
- Click into movie to see more details

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/annie-beau/Movie-Search.git
```
- in Info.plist add "API_KEY" with the provided api key

## Next Steps
If given more time here are the things that I would do:
- add loaders for loading the async images and to making the loadNextPage call
- add error handling and changes the async funcs to also throw
- clean up api pagination, distiguish between page change vs new query better
- UI Tests
